<!-- NOTES on automated checks:                                             -->
<!--                                                                        -->
<!--  * The PR build is only kicked off when the `bug` and/or `enhancement` -->
<!--    label is applied to the PR.                                         -->
<!--                                                                        -->
<!--  * Adding a comment with the phrase "run tests" or "rerun tests"       -->
<!--    will cause the PR check to run again.                               -->
<!--                                                                        -->
<!--  * Remove the substring "NO_" from the magic phrase "skip_NO_build"    -->
<!--    in order to skip the build, even when the label(s) mentioned above  -->
<!--    are attached. If you use this phrase, you will need to remove it    -->
<!--    and then add a "(re)run tests" comment if you want an auto-build.   -->

<!-- And commenting with "rerun tests" or "run tests" will force the PR check -->
